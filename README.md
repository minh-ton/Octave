This is a tweak that I created and abandoned (since I stopped jailbreaking my iPhone) back in 2021. I've just came across the source code of this tweak recently, and I feel like publishing this (still incomplete) tweak on GitHub for archival is a great idea!

Above are some of the screenshots that I've taken when the tweak is still in development. The tweak is still likely to work without the lyrics feature though, since I just web-scraping [this website](https://azlyrics.com) and I don't know if it's still working, and you can't even see your notifications while the music player is active. Well, just try the tweak!

## Installation
You can download the (development) deb package from [Releases](https://github.com/minh-ton/Octave/releases), or use [theos](https://github.com/theos/theos) to compile the tweak and install on your device.
